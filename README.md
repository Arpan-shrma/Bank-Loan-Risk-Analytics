Project Description:-
Bank Loan Case Study is about finding trends and insights about loan application dataset from the bank. In this project, I have used the application_data and previous_application dataset provided by trainity and drawn some conclusions. The aim of this project is to identify the customers who are capable of repaying loans. I have provided insights to topics and answered the questions asked by the management team. I have used Google Collab and Google sheets for data analytics and data visualization. In this case study, I will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
